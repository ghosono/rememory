# rememory
re.memory - an exploration of code + poetry

final for self and the call of the other, fall 2016

Our brains are machines. The cogs, synapses. The levers and nobs, electrical currents and chemical reactions. Somehow from all of this machinery memory arises.

Memory is a baffling concept because it blurs the line between what is static and nonstatic. While the details of an event are immutable, the way that the event gets conjured up changes every time it is remembered.

*Did we have lunch before we walked to the pond? or vice versa?*

Details give a cetainity to what may seem uncertain. A clarity in something otherwise opaque. It is these details that ~~we~~ I cling to when I'm looking back on events. These sounds, tastes, sights, and feelings are the building blocks of reconstructing a narrative past. Just like putting together a lego house or a complicated puzzle these pieces fit together into rigid constructions.

*"i see #{that thing} so clearly"*

Where our ability to comprehend fails, computers offer another way of viewing our ability to remember. I wrote a program that takes the details of various personal experiences and tries to fit them into the syntax of memory, a sentence construction that are missing sensory details. With a little bit of nifty math, I made it so that (virtually) every time the program is run the "memories" recombine differently.

I made two types of constructions: "now" statements that are declarative and imperative; "whispering" statements that look inward and are more speculative. Ruby is the perfect language for this becuase it is so elegant. For example, in the first line "nostalgia" is defined as a random number and is "returned" (a play on the Greek origins of the word meaning the "pain of returning"). I hope that the readability of Ruby can allow anyone to understand what is happening in the program, even without knowing any computer science.

*"the silence is an eternity without #{that person}"*

This program has offered me a bit of a catharsis. It speaks to me every time I run it. It gives me a new way of putting order in the chaos of experience. Since first writing a draft of this program in March, I've added to it little by little. I hope that it speaks to you the same way.
